# SocialGraph
A Social Graph written in Java — Includes Authentication, REST API, follow graph and more.

Alpha version
-------------

A large portion of the functionality is there, I've removed the advanced authentication code as I'm commericalizing that element.

If removing those classes has broken anything, I'll that fix later in the week along with documenting the REST API.

There is some code duplication in classes, as some classes are being optimised / rewritten.

When the storage classes are built this can interface into any database engine and caching layer.

NOTE: This isn't production ready, more work has to be done on the storage, and performance.

CPU intensive code will be ported to Rust; ie encryption, hashing, etc.

GPU optimised authentication code will be released in the enterprise version.
